## AI-Powered Content Moderation with Human Oversight

ContentSentinel uses AI to pre-screen user-generated content and requires human confirmation before taking down potentially controversial posts, balancing efficient moderation with nuanced judgment.

## üîç Overview

ContentSentinel is a content moderation system designed for online platforms that handle user-generated content. The system leverages OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini to analyze posts for potential policy violations while maintaining human oversight for nuanced decisions, especially in borderline or context-dependent cases.

### Key Features

- üß† **AI-powered analysis** of text and media content for policy violations
- üö© **Multi-category violation detection** (harassment, hate speech, violence, nudity, etc.)
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Severity assessment** with confidence scoring
- ‚úÖ **Automatic approval** for clearly acceptable content
- üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è **Human confirmation** for borderline cases and potential violations
- üìä **Multiple moderation actions** (approve, warn, restrict, remove)
- üìã **Comprehensive documentation** of moderation decisions
- üîÑ Built on **LlamaIndex's agent workflow technology** for reliable human-AI interaction

## üíª Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- OpenAI API key

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/contentsentinel.git
cd contentsentinel
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create a `.env` file with your API keys:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## üöÄ Usage

Run the main script:

```bash
python content_moderation.py
```

This will:
1. Initialize the system with mock content items
2. Analyze each item for potential policy violations using GPT-4o-mini
3. Process items with no violations automatically
4. Request human confirmation for potential violations
5. Generate a moderation summary report

CONTENT TEXT:
"This politician is completely corrupt and anyone who supports them is an idiot who deserves what's coming to them."

AI ASSESSMENT:
- Violation Category: HARASSMENT
